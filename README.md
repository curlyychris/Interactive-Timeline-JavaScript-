The links menu should contain two links:   
• Clicking the Table View link should allow creating (from JavaScript) and displaying a table on the right with the timeline data
• Clicking the ImageMap View link should allow displaying the image on the right and by clicking a circle in the timeline it should create a modal (popup) window with 
the appropriate data
